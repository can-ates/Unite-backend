# Unite-backend
Early backend stages of community platform app

I am currently building spectrum chat alike app and
Node.js     
Express.js   
MongoDB     
Mongoose
(AS BACKEND)
will be used throughout this my very first full stack project

In MVP version of this project, chat will be excluded.
 -Goal is only to allow authenticated users to create communities,
                                      create posts and
                                      comment posts
